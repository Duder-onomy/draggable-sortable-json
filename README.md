# Draggable Sortable JSON

Do not use this yet, Still in progress.

Eventually, this will use a lib like [dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) but wrapping it up in more opinionated UI. So that, you can pass a JSON object, it will render the JSON into the DOM with styling. You can drag and sort and nest and mess with the json. Then eventually get this serialized json back out.

I am around 80% complete with the lib already but it exists in another project. So I will need to extract it and move it here so I can use it again.

Currently, I am using it to let users manipulate the site navigation on their web projects with a simple draga and sort and nest. (think WP).

Nothing like this exists and would be super useful.

PEACE!
